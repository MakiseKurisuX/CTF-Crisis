    "This challenge involves the forcing of a false positive in the Artificial Intelligence, which in general, is the less damaging of the two forms of phishing attacks. So, why are we going through false positives? This is because false positives has caused more time loss as compared to the other variant. False positive phishing emails can cause either investigation time to be lost, or have even legitimate working emails be flagged and may ultimately cause confusion among workgroups due to communication breakdown. What does this ultimately mean? This means that productivity ultimately suffers greatly due to such circumstances, and is why we are doing this CTF."
