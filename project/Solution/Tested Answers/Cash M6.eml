    Dear Michelle---Just a note to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
    you<br>
    today.  Thank you for taking time to learn more about my background
    and<br>
    experience and to share your Enron story with me.  I am very
    interested in<br>
    the available position because I welcome the opportunity to learn
    new things<br>
    and improve my skills.  Although I have not worked at a law firm, I
    am<br>
    fortunate to say that my in-house experience has been very hands-on
    with most<br>
    of the transactions and all of the labor matters handled without
    outside<br>
    counsel.  I discussed this point at some length with Elizabeth Sager
    and left<br>
    a reference list with Molly McGee in HR.  Looking forward to hearing
    from you<br>
    <p>soon,</p>
    <p><a
