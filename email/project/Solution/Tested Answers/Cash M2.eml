    Michelle,<br>
    <br>
    Don't know that this alternative would be too appealing to the
    candidate, but <br>
    I can explore it with Mark.<br>
    <br>
    What would happen if we hire him as an Enron employee, he has a mid
    year <br>
    review that is not stellar, and then by September of next year we
    decide to <br>
    <p>terminate for non-performance?</p>
    <p>By the way, good manga</p>
