    <p>I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if
      that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably
      about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and
      how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization
      requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the
      organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns
      you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if
      there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss
      basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel
      free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the
      group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who
      they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a
      preference for morning or afternoon.</p>
